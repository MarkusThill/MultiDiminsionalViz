# Visualization of High-Dimensional Data with Parallel Coordinates

The remarkable ability of the human brain to recognize patterns in graphical representations of data is the main reason that visual methods still play a crucial role in data-mining tasks. Humans are capable of detecting relevant as well as irrelevant structures in data and drawing the correct conclusions from them, if the data is visualized in a suitable way. However, developing appropriate tools for visualization purposes is a very challenging task, especially for high-dimensional data, which always -- due to the limited human spatial perception of max. three dimensions -- implies a mapping to lower dimensions. Parallel Coordinates (commonly &#x7C;&#x7C;-Coordinates), invented by *Alfred Inselberg* follow such an approach by mapping high dimensional data to 2D using a comprehensible methodology. Furthermore, we will apply &#x7C;&#x7C;-Coordinates to various datasets and compare the results to several other visualization techniques. The resources used for [this blog-post](https://markusthill.github.io//visualizing-high-dimensional-data-with-parallel-coordinates//#read-more) are collected in this repository.

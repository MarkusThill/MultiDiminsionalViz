   I no longer have the description handed out during the JSM, but can
tell you how I generated the data, in minitab.

1. Part A was generated: 5000 (I think) 5-variable, uncorrelated, i.i.d.
Gaussian observations.

2. To get part B, I duplicated part A, then reversed the sign on the
observations for 3 of the 5 variables.

3. Part B was appended to Part A.

4. The order of the observations was randomized.

5. While waiting for my tardy car-pool companion, I took a piece of
graph paper, and figured out a dot-matrix representation of the word,
"EUREKA."  I then added these observations to the "center" of the
datatset.

6. The data were scaled, by variable (something like 1,3,5,7,11).

7. The data were rotated, then translated.

8. A few points in space within the datacloud were chosen as ellipsoid
centers, then for each center, all observations within a (scaled and
rotated) radius were identified, and eliminated - to form ellipsoidal
voids.

9. The variables were given entirely ficticious names.

FYI, only the folks at Bell Labs, Murray Hill, found everything,
including the voids.

Hope this is helpful!

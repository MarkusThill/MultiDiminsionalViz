	<h3>Description of the dataset</h3>

	<p>
		The dataset for this assignment is composed of some properties of variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" white wine.<br><br>
	What we want is to understand the importance of these properties for the wine quality.<br><br>
	The dataset used is composed of 201 records with 7 attributes.<br>
	Attributes used here are: Fixed acidity, Citric Acid, Residual Sugar, Total sulfur dioxide, pH, alcohol and quality.
	These attributes are the ones which have in my opinion the most important relevance for wine quality.<br>
	The original dataset is composed of 4899 records and 12 attributes, it can be found here (<a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv">link</a>).
	<br><br>
	What we have got from the analysis can be seen in this pictures:<br>

	<a href="./Lab assignment Data collection and plotting,Nicola Dorigatti 138430_files/qlty-res-high.png"><img src="./Lab assignment Data collection and plotting,Nicola Dorigatti 138430_files/qlty-res-high.png" width="683" height="106" border="1"></a><br><br>
	First of all, the images show respectively the parallel coordinates for low quality white wines, and parallel coordinates for high quality white wines.<br>
	As can be seen, there is only one constraint in the pictures which is wine quality. In the first picture only wines with low quality (less or equal 5) are shown, and as you can see, 
	there is no fixed schema for the values of the other properties for low quality wines.<br>
	In the second image, you can see that high quality wines tend to have similar values, except for pH which is not easy to set in a proper value (it is a combination of many aspects and can change, 
	in a minor value, also by the container in which the wine is put). One aspect that comes easily is that, for high quality wines there are three properties which are required:<br>
	</p><ul>
		<li>Residual Sugar</li>
		<li>Total sulfur dioxide</li>
		<li>Alcohol</li>
	</ul>
	Residual Sugar is a parameter that indicates, as its name says, the sugar residual in wine, and the higher it is the easier for the wine to lose its taste and get to vinegar. 
	Hence a good wine has to have as little as possible residual sugar.<br>
	Total sulfur dioxide instead is a value that indicates how much sulfur dioxide is present in the wine. It is important because sulfur dioxide helps the wine to avoid the process of fermentation, 
	and reduces the probability of getting to vinegar, but it must not be too high because
	sulfur dioxide produces headache and it modifies the taste of wine.<br>
	Third attribute is Alcohol and I think there is not too much to say about it. The higher it is the better the white wine. But it is not as important as the two previous parameters, 
	in fact there is a high quality wine which has alcohol value of 10 (that is not the highest value for a white wine).<br>
	<br>
	About residual sugar there is another picture that shows the correlation between quality and Residual Sugar in a ScatterPlot.<br><br>
	<a href="./Lab assignment Data collection and plotting,Nicola Dorigatti 138430_files/qlty-res-sp.png"><img src="./Lab assignment Data collection and plotting,Nicola Dorigatti 138430_files/qlty-res-sp.png" width="683" height="387" border="1"></a><br><br>
	As you can see, wines with higher quality (on the right) have very low residual sugar, but also low quality wines have low values of residual, 
	hence this is important but is not the unique important parameter (as mentioned above).<br>
	<br>
	Then here it is another important scatterplot which shows a relation between residual sugar and total sulfur dioxide.<br><br>
	<a href="./Lab assignment Data collection and plotting,Nicola Dorigatti 138430_files/sulf-res-sp.png"><img src="./Lab assignment Data collection and plotting,Nicola Dorigatti 138430_files/sulf-res-sp.png" width="683" height="387" border="1"></a><br><br>
	In the ScatterPlot you can see residual sugar (rs) on the X axis and total sulfur dioxide (tsd) on the Y axis. As you can see for high values of 
	<i>rs</i>, the <i>tsd</i> value tends to be high. This is due to the fact that in order to contrast the issues related to high value 
	of residual sugar, the wine needs to have high quantity of <i>tsd</i>, and this can lead to a poor quality wine. The relation between	
	<i>tsd</i> and <i>rs</i> is not direct; in fact high level of residual sugar can lead to high quantity of <i>tsd</i>, instead high level 
	of <i>tsd</i> does not mean that there is high level of <i>rs</i>. Although the reasoning mentioned here lets people to think that these
	two parameters are not correlated (or not strictly correlated) it is very important to consider them together. They have, if taken together, a high
    impact on wine quality.	
	<br>
	Here are shown some other useful pictures taken during analysis, that show respectively the scatter plot grid for each pair of values and the parallel 
	coordinates without filtering on quality. Next image is a 3D rendering which shows some items with respect
	to some filtering set in the parallel coordinates box of the same picture. Three close items are flagged, and by looking at the parallel coordinates highlighted 
	you can see the importance of the three attributes explained,
	also that alcohol is not as important as residual sugar and total sulfur dioxide.<br><br>
